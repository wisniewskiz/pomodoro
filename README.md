### About
The Pomodoro technique is a method of time management that suggesets working in 25 minute intervals with short breaks inbetween. It was developed in the late 1980's by Francesco Cirillo and named after the tomato shaped kitched timer (pomodoro is Italian for tomato) that he used as a university student. The original technique is employed as follows:
1. Decide on the task to be done. 
2. Set the pomodoro timer, traditionally 25 minutes
3. Work on the task till the timer ends
4. When the timer is finished, add a checkmark to a piece of paper to track how many intervals you have worked. 
5. **If you have fewer than four checkmarks at the end of they cycle**, take a short break of 3 to 5 minutes, and return to step 2. *Otherwise* continue to step 6. 
6. **AFter four cycles** take a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes. Then reset your checkmark count to zero and return to step 1.
